      <p>
        The object of the game is to win the favor of 4 Geisha or to have 11 Charm Points. (There is a maximum of 7
        Geisha and 21 Charm Points.)
      </p>
      <p>You and your opponent take turns performing actions in order to play Item Cards.</p>
      <p>
        At the end of a round, for each Geisha, if you have more Item Cards of the corresponding type than your
        opponent, you win the Geisha's favor and gain Charm Points equal to the number on the Geisha Card.
      </p>
      <p>The game continues until one player achieves a winning score at the end of a round.</p>

    <div class="flex flex-col gap-2 pt-1">
      <p>After both players have performed 4 actions, each player reveals and plays their hidden card from Action 1.</p>
      <p>
        Then for each Geisha, compare the number of Item Cards each player has played on their side of the board. If one
        player has more Item Cards, move the Victory Marker for that Geisha to that player's side.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Victory Marker on a player's side means that that player wins the Geisha and gains Charm Points equal to the
        number on the Geisha Card.
      </p>
      <p>
        After determining the position of each Victory Marker, calculate the number of Geisha and Charm Points each
        player has.
      </p>
      <p>If no player has won, reset the deck and start another round.</p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that Victory Markers remain in place, so during the next round's scoring phase, a player will win a
        Geisha if the Victory Marker is already on that player's side and the number of Item Cards is tied.
